       Hello and welcome to the online page for Walt's Cheap Commodities! This thrift store business was founded all the way back in 1972 in a 
       little town in albuquerque new mexico. A man by the name of Walt Blanco had a dream of making his very own retail store but a store where 
       people could buy things at an affordable price. When he was a young lad, he worked at family owned grocery store with his brother in law hank. 
       As a time went on Walt saved up enough money working at the grocery store and working other odd jobs to finally open his store. 
       Unfortunately, during the midst of the early mid to late early 2000s Walt's Cheap Commodities started losing business, and for a time It
       seemed that walt's was on the doorstep of bankruptcy....

       Until Now!!! Started with a slight rebranding project in 2008 Walt's thirft store is a place where you can sell and buy used items
       as well as buy all of your at home needs like, clothes, footwear, electronics, hardware, toys, games, and more! Now In the convience of your
       own home! Even though Walt Blanco is long gone now, his son flynn is keeping his dream alive through the ways of the Digital Marketplace.
